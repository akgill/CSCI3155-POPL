JavaScript is a language with many obvious problems, as outlined by Douglas Crockford in his article "JavaScript: The World's Most Misunderstood Programming Language"  ([Crockford1]). And yet it is a very widely used language. Why do so many people use it?  Well, to quote Crockford in [_JavaScript: The Good Parts_ by Douglas Crockford, Yahoo, 2008],
> There are two answers. The first is that you don't have a choice. The Web has become an important platform for application development, and JavaScript is the only language that is found in all browsers... The other answer is that, despite its deficiencies, *JavaScript is really good.* It is lightweight and expressive. And once you get the hang of it, functional programming is a lot of fun.

JavaScript was able to hang onto the limelight despite it's bad reputation because of its widespread adoption in all browser systems, after implementation by Netscape Navigator and appropriation by Microsoft's Internet Explorer and all subsequent major browsers ([Crockford2]). JavaScript has therefore always been popularly in use by those looking to write code for the web, from amateur non-programmers to the disgruntled, JavaScript-hating, experienced programmer.

However, JavaScript has experienced a renewal in interest by seasoned programmers since its initial, poorly received debut. The reason for this revival is because JavaScript is a powerful functional programming language, despite its many shortcomings. Functional programming languages, as opposed to the more common imperative programming languages, evaluate expressions rather than following explict series of actions.  As such they teach programmers new ways to think about languages and approach problems.

Many of the arguments made in favor of LISP by Paul [Graham] in "Revenge of the Nerds" would also apply to JavaScript. 
Professor Baker, as a graduate of Brown University, probably learned Scheme as his first programming language in the Brown curriculum for the same purpose: functional programming languages teach programmers new ways to think about languages and approach problems.
JavaScript has many of the advantages of more widely lauded functional languages such as lambda functions and closures. Other advantages, [noted by John Resig of Khan Academy] (who have adopted JavaScript as a first language for teaching in their curriculum), include
>...its ubiquity, desirability in the larger workforce, lack of prior installation requirements, and ability to create something thatâ€™s easy to share with friends.

Ultimately, JavaScript has been and is experiencing a popular resurgence (beyond its use in the browser platform) because it is a widely available and powerful functional programming language.
