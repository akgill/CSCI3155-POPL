Warmup Documentation
===================

1. Created correct file hierarchy
    * warmup
        - README.md
        - build.sbt
        * src
            * main
                * scala
                    - Warmup.scala
            * test
                * scala
                    - WarmupSpec.scala

2. Completed the warmup exercises, putting all testing code in WarmupSpec.scala and putting all object and method definitions in Warmup.scala. Ran tests using 'sbt test' in warmup folder to verify correctness.
