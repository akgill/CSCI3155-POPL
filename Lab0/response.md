Paul Graham's premise in *Beating the Averages* is that the most powerful tool is always the one that should be used, defining 'most powerful' as having the most features. I would argue that the tool most suited to one's needs is the best tool to use.

Consider the following question. Which is a better tool: a 32 piece screwdriver set with flat, phillips, pozi, hex, and torque fittings, or a swiss army knife? A survivalist would choose the swiss army knife - an extremely versatile tool in a small lightweight package. However, no professional instrumenter would ever choose a swiss army knife over a screwdriver set. The precision offered by a full driver set is exactly what the instrument builder would need and weight is not an issue. Neither the survivalist nor the instrumenter are "wrong" in their choice of tool. The choice depends strongly on context.

Programming languages are no different. The 'power' of a programming language can only be spoken of in a given context and it is the contextual definition of 'powerful' that dictates which programming language should be used.

Even within a given field, one may need to use several different languages for different purposes depending on the task. In astrophysical computing settings, IDL, Matlab, and Python are all popular, and they each have their own unique sets of advantages. IDL and Matlab are both array optimized languages with substantial libraries and packages available for statistical analysis. IDL is the unquestioned champion for image analysis applications in fields as far ranging as astrophysics and surveillance. Matlab, by contrast, has the advantages of being parallelizable (increasingly important for theoretical astrophysics, or expensive parameter space searching) and designed to communicate directly with most laboratory equipment making it the only reasonable tool for automated data collection, instrument monitoring, and remote instrument control. Python is gaining traction as a non-proprietary (so your collaborators can access it), powerful language for pipeline development that supports parallelized computing, although lacking in the specialized libraries of the other two languages. Science has the additional constraint of being inherently collaborative. One is often building upon the work of decades. It is therefore sometimes most expedient, for compatitbility, to work in languages many would consider obsolete, e.g. Fortran. As Graham notes, it is often expediency, rather than beauty, that drives language choice. In a scientific context, and in all other contexts, one size does not fit all and the most efficient tool for development depends strongly on the intended application of that tool.

The missing factor that Graham's piece does not address is that 'power' is a context dependent quantity and 'the most powerful language' cannot be determined based solely on its intrinsic properties, e.g. the quantity of available features. Ultimately the tool must be well suited to its task.
